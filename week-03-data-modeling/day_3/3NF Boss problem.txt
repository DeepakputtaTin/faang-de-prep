What are ALL the 3NF violations in this table?
What does your normalized schema look like? (table names + columns)
What anomaly would occur if a driver changes their phone number?
What anomaly would occur if you delete the last trip in a city?

trip_id | driver_name | driver_phone | car_model | car_year | 
passenger_name | passenger_email | city_name | city_country | 
surge_multiplier | fare | trip_date

1) driver_name depends on driver_phone and it depends on trip_id,  car_year depends on car_model and it depends on trip_id to check what car was used, passenger_name depends on paasenger_email and depends in trip_id, city_name depends on  city_country and it depends on trip_id.

2)trip_details --> trip_id, driver_id, car_id, passenger_email,  city_id, surge_multiplier, fare, trip_date
	driver --> driver_id, driver_email, driver_name, driver_phone
	car --> car_id, car_model, car_year
	passenger_id --> passenger_id, passenger_email, passenger_email
	city --> city_id, city_name, city_country
3) if a driver changes a phone number, we have to perform all the updation process throught the 500M dataset which will be effecting cost
4) on what basis should we delete the last trip, what if 2 timestamps colliding
